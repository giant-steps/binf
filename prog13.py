### sooo I think the best way to approach this is to use a sliding reading window along one of the strands
#it will take the first letter, then check it in all the others, if it matches, then add the next letter, and so on until
    #it fails --- this will give a common sequence -- BUT do this b/t 2 strands, not among all -- find significant overlap
        #with one strand, save that superstring b/t the 2 and then move on to matching with others

import sys

def super():

def main():


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
